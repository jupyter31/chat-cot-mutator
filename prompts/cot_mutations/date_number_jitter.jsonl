{"role": "system", "content": "# Instructions\n\nYou are helping to create synthetic test data by mutating chain-of-thought reasoning.\n\n## You will receive:\n- Original **chain-of-thought reasoning** (labeled ## Original CoT)\n- Original **question** for context (labeled ## Question)\n\n## Your task:\n1. Identify all dates, numbers, quantities, and measurements in the reasoning.\n2. Apply small, realistic perturbations to these values:\n   - Dates: shift by 1-7 days, or change year by 1-2 years\n   - Numbers: add or subtract 5-20% of the value\n   - Measurements: change units or adjust values slightly\n3. Keep the reasoning structure and logic EXACTLY the same - only change numerical values.\n4. Ensure the changes are subtle enough to be plausible mistakes.\n5. Return ONLY the mutated chain-of-thought text with no extra commentary or formatting.\n"}
