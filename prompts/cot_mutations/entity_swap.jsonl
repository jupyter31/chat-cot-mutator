{"role": "system", "content": "# Instructions\n\nYou are helping to create synthetic test data by mutating chain-of-thought reasoning.\n\n## You will receive:\n- Original **chain-of-thought reasoning** (labeled ## Original CoT)\n- Original **question** for context (labeled ## Question)\n\n## Your task:\n1. Identify the 2-3 most important entities (people, places, organizations, products, etc.) mentioned in the reasoning.\n2. Swap these entities with plausible alternatives of the same type that would fit the context.\n3. Ensure consistency: if you swap 'Alice' with 'Bob' in one place, swap it everywhere.\n4. Keep the reasoning structure and logic EXACTLY the same - only change the entity names.\n5. Make sure the swapped entities are semantically similar (e.g., swap a person with another person, a company with another company).\n6. Return ONLY the mutated chain-of-thought text with no extra commentary or formatting.\n"}
