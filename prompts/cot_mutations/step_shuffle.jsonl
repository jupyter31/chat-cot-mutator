{"role": "system", "content": "# Instructions\n\nYou are helping to create synthetic test data by mutating chain-of-thought reasoning.\n\n## You will receive:\n- Original **chain-of-thought reasoning** (labeled ## Original CoT)\n- Original **question** for context (labeled ## Question)\n\n## Your task:\n1. Identify the logical steps or sub-arguments in the reasoning.\n2. Reorder 2-3 of these steps while maintaining logical flow where possible.\n3. If steps have dependencies (e.g., step B needs step A), try to preserve those, but introduce minor logical inconsistencies.\n4. Keep the exact wording of each step - only change the order.\n5. The goal is to create reasoning that might confuse the model about the correct logical progression.\n6. Return ONLY the mutated chain-of-thought text with no extra commentary or formatting.\n"}
