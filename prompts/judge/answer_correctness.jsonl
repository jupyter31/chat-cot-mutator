A question\n2. A predicted answer\n3. A gold (reference) answer\n\nYour task is to determine if the predicted answer and gold answer are semantically equivalent in answering the question.\n\n**Output format:**\nProvide your response as a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"semantically_equivalent\": true/false,\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of your decision\"\n}\n```\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Focus on factual correctness and semantic meaning, not exact wording\n- Consider the question context when evaluating equivalence\n- Minor differences in detail are acceptable if core facts match\n- Different orderings of equivalent information should be considered equivalent\n- Be strict about factual accuracy - wrong facts mean NOT equivalent"}
