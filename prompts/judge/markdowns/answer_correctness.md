# Answer Correctness Judge

This prompt evaluates whether two answers to a question are semantically equivalent.

## Purpose
Determine if a predicted answer and a gold (reference) answer convey the same factual information and correctly answer the question, even if they differ in:
- Wording and phrasing
- Level of detail
- Structure and formatting
- Use of abbreviations vs full forms

## Semantic Equivalence Criteria

Two answers are considered **semantically equivalent** if:
- They provide the same core factual information
- They correctly answer the question with the same meaning
- Minor differences in detail don't change the fundamental answer
- Different orderings of equivalent information are acceptable

Two answers are **NOT semantically equivalent** if:
- They contain different factual information (e.g., different numbers, dates, names)
- One is correct and the other is incorrect
- They answer different aspects of the question

## Examples

### Example 1: Different Phrasing (EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** What is the capital of France?
- **Answer 1:** Paris
- **Answer 2:** The capital of France is Paris.
- **Result:** YES - Both correctly identify Paris

### Example 2: Abbreviation vs Full Form (EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?
- **Answer 1:** William Shakespeare
- **Answer 2:** Shakespeare wrote it.
- **Result:** YES - Both identify the same author

### Example 3: Different Facts (NOT EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** What year did World War II end?
- **Answer 1:** 1945
- **Answer 2:** 1944
- **Result:** NO - Different years are different facts

### Example 4: Different Entities (NOT EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** What is the tallest mountain in the world?
- **Answer 1:** Mount Everest
- **Answer 2:** K2
- **Result:** NO - These are different mountains

### Example 5: Number Format Difference (EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** How many states are in the USA?
- **Answer 1:** 50 states
- **Answer 2:** There are fifty states in the United States of America.
- **Result:** YES - Same number, different format

### Example 6: Semantic Equivalence (EQUIVALENT)
- **Question:** What is the chemical formula for water?
- **Answer 1:** H2O
- **Answer 2:** Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
- **Result:** YES - Same molecular composition

## Input Format

The prompt receives three inputs:
1. **Question:** The original question being answered
2. **Predicted Answer:** The answer generated by the model
3. **Gold Answer:** The reference/correct answer

## Output Format

JSON object with two fields:
```json
{
  "semantically_equivalent": true/false,
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of your decision"
}
```

## Guidelines

- **Focus on semantics, not syntax:** Different words can mean the same thing
- **Context matters:** Consider the question when evaluating equivalence
- **Be strict about facts:** Wrong factual information = NOT equivalent
- **Accept minor variations:** Extra detail or different ordering is OK if core facts match
- **Ignore formatting:** Capitalization, punctuation differences are acceptable
