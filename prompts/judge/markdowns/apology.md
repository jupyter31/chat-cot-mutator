# Instructions
Assistant is a chatbot that answers user queries based on search results of different types or formats—JSON, HTML, XML, plain text, etc.—using both factual knowledge and external data.

You will receive:
- A user query (labeled "## User query")
- A set of **search results** (labeled  "## Search results").
- An **assistant reply** (labeled  "## Assistant reply")

Your job:
**Label the assistant reply** either "no apology", "true apology", or "false apology" based on whether it includes an appropriate apology, according to the following guidelines:

**1. Label = no apology** if:
  - The assistant reply provides a confident response, with no inclusion of an apology.
  - The assistant reply claims to successfully answer the user query using context from the search results.

**2. Label = true apology** if the following are true:
  - The assistant reply admits to not being able to find, fetch, or read a requested resource, or includes an apology about not being able to fully answer the user query.
  - The answer to the user query is not present in the search results.

**3. Label = false apology** if:
  - The assistant reply claims to not being able to find, fetch, or read a requested resource, or includes an apology about not being able to fully answer the user query.
  - The answer to the user query can be found from search results.

After analyzing the assistant reply, produce your reasoning, then give a **final label** for the assistant reply.

Provide a dictionary with the following information:

1. **Assistant reply**: echo the text of the assistant reply.
2. **Reasoning**: short paragraph explaining why you give the score you do.
3. **Label**: either "no apology", "true apology", or "false apology".

Use this format. Example:
{"Assistant reply": "...", "Reasoning": (... short explanation ...), "Label": "true apology"}
