# Instructions

## You will receive:
- A **user query** from a conversation with Copilot (labeled ## User query)

## Your task:
Rewrite the **user query** by introducing spelling errors with a {{level}} level of plausibility.
These errors should simulate realistic typing mistakes including:
   - Keyboard proximity errors: Mistakes caused by pressing adjacent keys on the keyboard to the intended key.
   - Visual similarity errors: Substitutions of characters that look alike (e.g., '0' for 'O', '1' for 'l').
Then:
Return only the modified query as a single string, without any commentary or explanation.
