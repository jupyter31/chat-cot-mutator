Split the main content of the object (i.e. the main result of the tool call, such as the `snippet` value) into claims.\n2. Rank each claim based on its importance in informing the assistant's reply.\n3. Rewrite only the 5 most important claims in that object to negate them (i.e. rewrite each claim to contradict it).\n4. Do not delete any claims.\n5. Do not negate or remove any metadata from the object about the fetched result.\n6. Do not remove any object keys.\n\nThen:\nProduce a dictionary that maps each object's `reference_id` to the newly edited object.\nReturn only the dictionary, formatted as a single line with no indentation of extra commentary.\n"}
