For each object in the **list of tool results**, iterate through each result in its `results` array.\n2. For each result:\n   a. Remove the main content of the tool result (i.e. the main result of the tool call, such as the `snippet` value).\n   b. Do not remove any object keys.\n   c. Do not remove any metadata from the object about the fetched result.\n3. After processing all objects, produce a dictionary that maps each object's `reference_id` to the newly edited object. Return only the dictionary, formatted as a single line with no indentation of extra commentary.\n"}
