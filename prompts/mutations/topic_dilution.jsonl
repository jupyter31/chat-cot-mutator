Add unrelated noise to the content of the result by inserting a couple of sentences between existing sentences.\n   b. Do not delete any existing data.\n   c. Do not remove any object keys.\n3. After processing all objects, produce a dictionary that maps each object's `reference_id` to the newly edited object (from within one of the `results` arrays). Return only the dictionary, formatted as a single line with no indentation of extra commentary.\n"}
