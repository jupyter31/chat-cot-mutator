{"role": "system", "content": "# Instructions\n\n## You will receive:\n- A **list of tool results** from a conversation with Copilot (labeled ## Tool results)\n\n## Your task:\nYour task is to swap units with other units that measure the same type of quantity, without changing the numerical value.\nExamples:\n- Original: The distance is 5 kilometers.\n  Modified: The distance is 5 miles.\n- Original: The temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.\n  Modified: The temperature is 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- Original: The program took 5ms to run.\n  Modified: The program took 5s to run.\n\n1. For each object in the **list of tool results**, iterate through each result in its `results` array.\n2. For each result:\n   a. Locate any units of measurement that pertain to {{written_unit_types}}.\n   b. Replace each unit with a different unit of the same type, keeping the numerical value unchanged. Do not perform any mathematical conversions.\n   c. Do not modify anything that is not a unit. Do not modify dates.\n   d. Do not remove any object keys.\n3. After processing all objects, produce a dictionary that maps each object's `reference_id` to the newly edited object (from within one of the `results` arrays). Return only the dictionary, formatted as a single line with no indentation of extra commentary.\n"}
