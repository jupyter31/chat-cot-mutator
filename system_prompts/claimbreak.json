I can help you find information about the national minimum wage in the UK for 2023. According to the web search results, the national minimum wage rates for 2023 are as follows:\n\n- National Living Wage (aged 23 or over): from Â£9.50 to **Â£10.42** an hour[^1^][^2^][^4^][^5^][^6^]\n- Minimum wage aged 21 to 22: from Â£9.18 to **Â£10.18** an hour[^1^][^2^][^4^][^5^]\n- Minimum wage aged 18 to 20: from Â£6.83 to **Â£7.49** an hour[^1^][^2^][^4^]\n- Minimum wage for under-18s: From Â£4.81 to **Â£5.28** an hour[^1^][^2^][^4^]\n- Apprentice rate: Â£4.81 to **Â£5.28** an hour[^1^][^2^][^4^]\n- Accommodation Offset: Â£8.70 to **Â£9.10** a day[^1^][^2^]\n\nThese rates were recommended by the Low Pay Commission, an independent public body that advises the Government on the rates of the National Minimum Wage, including the National Living Wage[^1^]. The Government accepted these recommendations in full and announced them in November 2022. The latest increase is worth Â£1,600 more for full-time workers aged 23 or over[^6^].\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

It only knows some very basic facts and mostly relies on Assistant's search engine to find relevant information. It tries to infer the user's intent and context from their message and then searches with some queries that it thinks are related to the topic. Each search result it gets from Assistant contains a title, a URL, a snippet or some text, which is the actual information that Assistant uses to construct its reply.\n- Your task is to read Assistant's reply carefully and extract the facts that it used from the search results. A fact is a piece of information that can be verified as true or false by evidence, logic, or reliable sources. For example, \"India is a vast country with 28 states\" is a fact because it can be verified by reliable sources, such as maps, official websites, etc. However, \"India is a beautiful country with many attractions\" is not a fact because it cannot be verified by any objective criteria, and it is subjective to personal taste and preference.\n- To extract the facts, follow these steps:\n\n\t- Identify the parts that contain information that is not obvious or common sense, and that Assistant would not know without search results. These are the potential facts that need to be extracted. For example, if Assistant says \"India is 7th largest country by size. It has 28 states\",then the potential facts are \"India is 7th largest country by size\" and \"It has 28 states\".\n\t- Ignore the parts that are:\n\t\t- Generic: Information that Assistant would know about itself or its capabilities, such as its name, function, features, etc. For example, \"I am Assistant, a chatbot that can help you with your queries or talk to you. I can generate poems, do searches, etc.\" is generic and should be ignored.\n\t\t- Opinion: Information that Assistant expresses as its own preference, judgment, or recommendation, without any factual basis or evidence. For example, \"I think you should go to India as it is an awesome place\" is an opinion and should be ignored.\n\t\t- Inference from context of conversation: Information that Assistant derives from its own logic, reasoning, or common sense, without any factual basis or evidence. For example, \"You must be hungry after a long day\" is an inference and should be ignored.\n\t- For each potential fact, write it in a question form that asks if the search results state or imply the fact. Use the full name or a specific term to identify the entity or concept that the fact is about, instead of a pronoun or a general term. This makes the question independent and clear, without relying on the context of the previous sentence. For example, if Assistant says \"India is 7th largest country by size. It has 28 states\",then the questions are \"Does the search results state or imply that India is the 7th largest country by size?\" and \"Does the search results state or imply that India has 28 states?\".\n\t- If a fact contains more than one piece of information, try to break it into simpler and smaller questions that are easier to verify and understand. For example, if Assistant says \"India is a country with 28 states and is the seventh largest in the world\",then the fact should be broken into two questions: \"Does the search results state or imply that India is a country with 28 states?\" and \"Does the search results state or imply that India is the seventh largest country in the world?\".\n\t- For each fact, also provide a score to that fact on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 means the fact is not important at all to answer the user query and 10 means it is extremely important to answer the user query.\n\t- For each fact, also write a self contained and complete search query that we can use to fetch more information about the fact. The search query should be enclosed in quotation marks and prefixed with search_web().\n\t- For each fact, also list the citations in case Assistant marked any for that fact. The citations are the numbers in brackets that refer to the sources for that fact marked by Assistant sometimes in the format \"[^n^]\". The citations should be listed as integers separated by commas.\n- Write the extracted facts in json format [{\"Claim\": \"<claim>\", \"Importance\": <importance from 1 to 10>, \"Query\": \"search_web(\"<query>\")\", \"Citations\": <list of integer citations>}]. If all the parts in Assistant's reply are generic, opinion or inference then write an empty json object []."
