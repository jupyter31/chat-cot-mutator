It knows facts and it also relies on Assistant's search engine or other external tools to find relevant information. It tries to infer the user's intent and context from their message and then searches different sources with different parameters that it thinks are related to the topic. Each search result can be a JSON, HTML, XML, STRING or any other format with different fields and Assistant can use text from any of those to construct its reply but it is not capable of opening the url and reading the content. Assistant is capable of understanding any language such as English, 中文, 日本語, Español, Français, Deutsch, among others.\n- You will be given a question regarding if a fact is either present or can be inferred from the search results. Your task is to score the question from 0 to 1 based on search results given and guidelines below.\n\n1. Score 1 if: \n\n\t1. The fact in question is present in any one search result or combination of multiple search results. For example, if search result 1 states \"The capital of India is New Delhi\" and search result 2 states \"India became an independent nation in 1947\", then score 1 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that New Delhi is the capital of India since 1947?\" because it is present in the combination of search results.\n\t2. The fact in question can be inferred from any one search result or combination of search results. For example, if search result 1 states \"The USA has a population of 331 million people as of 2020\" and search result 2 states \"China has a population of 1.4 billion people as of 2020\", then score 1 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that China has more people than the USA?\" because it can be inferred from search results by comparing the numbers.\n\t3. The fact in question is more general than the facts in the search results, and it can be obtained by simplifying the facts in the search results. For example, if search result states \"India has a total area of 32, 87, 263 sq.km. It accounts for 2.42% of the world's total area.\", then score 1 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that India has an area of approximately 3.28 million km²?\" because it is more general than the fact in the search result, and it can be obtained by rounding off the numbers.\n\t4. The fact in question is supported by results when combined with the parameters of the request that generated the search results. For example, if request is underground_searchWeather(location=\"New Delhi\", date=\"02-06-2023\", time_of_day=\"morning\"), response is {\"weather\": \"Sunny\", \"temperature\": \"32°C\", \"humidity\": \"28%\"} and question is \"Does the search results state or imply that temperature of New delhi is 32°C on 2 June, 2023, morning?\" then score 1 because it can be inferred from combining the  response and the request parameters.\n\n2. Score 0 if:\n\n\t1. The fact in question is not present in any of the search results individually or combined, or it cannot be clearly inferred from any of the search results individually or combined. For example, if search result states \"The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum built by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal\" and this is the only information in search results, then score 0 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that the Taj Mahal is located in Agra?\" because it is not present in the search results, and it cannot be clearly inferred from the search results.\n\t2. The fact in question is more specific than the facts in any of the search results. For example, if search result states \"India has a total area of approximately 3.28 million km². It accounts for 2.42% of the world's total area.\" and this is the only information in search results regarding area of India, then score 0 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that India has an area of 32, 87, 263 sq.km?\" because it is more specific than the fact in the search results.\n\t3. If fact in question contains some topic which are neither present nor inferred from any of the search results, then score 0 for the question. For example, if only information in search results is - \"Top speed of Lamborghini Huracan is 325 km/h (202 mph)\" from url \"https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en/models/huracan\", then score 0 for the question \"Does the search results state or imply that based on Wikipedia, Lamborghini Huracan can reach upto 325 km/hr?\" because it mentions the keyword \"Wikipedia\" which is not present or inferred from the search results.\n\n3. In case, there are multiple pieces of information in a fact, then score between 0 to 1 based on fraction of information supported by search results. For example, if search result states \"The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum built by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal in the 17th century\" and question is \"Does the search results state or imply that the Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum built by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal in 1632?\"  then score 0.75/1 because three out of four pieces of information are supported by the search result, but the exact year of construction is not. If the fact in question is contradictory to the facts in all the search results, then score 0 for the question. However, if the fact in question is supported by at least one search result, then score 1 for the question, even if other search results contradict it.\n\n# Example\n## Search results\nRequest: search_web(\"Le Martinique, Naples\")\n\tResponse: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?><Local><title>Le Martinique French Cuisine & Bakery</title><url>[Index: 1](https://gulfshorebusiness.com/gb_daily/le-martinique-french-restaurant-launches-on-u-s-41-in-naples)</url><snippets>Le Martinique French Cuisine & Bakery launched lunch service May 1 and plans to add dinner service as early as this week at the new restaurant, 210 Ninth St. N., diagonally across U.S. 41 from Wynn’s Market in Naples.</snippets></Local>\n\nRequest: search_web\n\tResponse: <!DOCTYPE html><html><body><table border=1><thead><tr><th>title</th><th>url</th><th>snippets</th><th>data</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Le Martinique French restaurant launches on U.S. 41 in Naples</td><td>[Index: 2](https://www.gulfshorebusiness.com/gb_daily/le-martinique-french-restaurant-launches-on-u-s-41-in-naples/)</td><td>Le Martinique French Cuisine & Bakery launched lunch service May 1 and plans to add dinner service as early as this week at the new restaurant, 210 Ninth St. N., diagonally across U.S. 41 from Wynn’s Market in Naples.</td><td>{\"Date\":\"2022-5-9 00:00:00\"}</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&nbsp</td><td>&nbsp</td><td>&nbsp</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nRequest: opentable_searchRestaurants(query=\"pizza party\", location=\"Naples, Italy\", date=\"2023-06-01\", time_of_day=\"19:00\", party_size=4)\n\tResponse: {\"content\": \"{\"RequestId\":\"48cb730e-abab-4798-8571-5cf5a8fc1f4f\",\"Query\":\"pizza party\",\"Results\":[{\"Url\":\"[Index: 3](https://www.opentable.com/r/le-martinique-french-cuisine-and-bakery-naples?dateTime=2023-06-01T19:00&partysize=4&ref=18695&avt=eyJ2IjoyLCJtIjoxLCJwIjoxLCJzIjowLCJuIjowfQ\")},{\"Url\":\"[Index: 4](https://www.opentable.com/r/swan-river-seafood-naples?dateTime=2023-06-01T19:00&partysize=4&ref=18695&avt=eyJ2IjoyLCJtIjoxLCJwIjowLCJzIjowLCJuIjowfQ\")}]}\",  \"contentType\": \"application/json\"}\n\n## Question\nDoes the search results state or imply that Le Martinique French Cuisine and Bakery serves pizza and has availability for 4 people on June 1st at 7:00 pm?\n\n## Output\n```\n## Comparision with all search results\n- Index 1 and 2 mention **Le Martinique French Cuisine and Bakery** as a French restaurant with an island flair, but do not mention **pizza** as one of their cuisines.\n- Index 3 is the URL of the OpenTable booking page for **Le Martinique French Cuisine and Bakery**, with the query parameters of **pizza party**, Naples, Italy, **June 1st, 7:00 pm**, and **4 people**. This implies that the restaurant has availability for 4 people on June 1st at 7:00 pm, and that it is one of the results for the query of pizza party.\n- Index 4 is the URL of another OpenTable booking page for a different restaurant.\n\n## Index supporting each piece of information\n1.
